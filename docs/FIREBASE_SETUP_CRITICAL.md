# 🚨 CRITICAL: Firebase Configuration Issues & Fixes

## Current Status

### ✅ FIXED
- [x] Moved `google-services.json` to correct location: `apps/mobile/android/app/`
- [x] Package names are consistent: `com.plateful.app` everywhere

### ❌ REQUIRES YOUR ACTION
- [ ] iOS app NOT properly registered in Firebase (PLACEHOLDER APP ID)
- [ ] Need to download real `GoogleService-Info.plist` from Firebase Console

---

## 🔥 URGENT: Fix iOS Firebase Configuration

### Problem
Your `GoogleService-Info.plist` has a **PLACEHOLDER** iOS App ID:
```xml
<key>GOOGLE_APP_ID</key>
<string>1:491097328247:ios:PLACEHOLDER_IOS_APP_ID</string>
```

This means **Firebase will NOT work on iOS** in production builds.

### Solution: Register iOS App in Firebase Console

**Step-by-step instructions:**

#### 1. Go to Firebase Console
```
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/plateful-83021/overview
```

#### 2. Add iOS App (or Re-download if it exists)

**Option A: If iOS app doesn't exist**
1. Click "Add app" → Choose iOS
2. Enter Bundle ID: `com.plateful.app`
3. Enter App Nickname: `Plateful iOS`
4. Click "Register app"
5. **Download `GoogleService-Info.plist`**
6. Skip the SDK setup steps (we already have Firebase installed)

**Option B: If iOS app already exists**
1. Click the iOS app in your Firebase project
2. Click the Settings gear icon → Project settings
3. Scroll to "Your apps" section
4. Find the iOS app with Bundle ID `com.plateful.app`
5. Click "Download `GoogleService-Info.plist`"

#### 3. Replace the Placeholder File

**BEFORE replacing**, backup the current file:
```bash
cp apps/mobile/ios/Plateful/GoogleService-Info.plist apps/mobile/ios/Plateful/GoogleService-Info.plist.backup
```

**Replace the file**:
```bash
# Move your downloaded file to:
mv ~/Downloads/GoogleService-Info.plist apps/mobile/ios/Plateful/GoogleService-Info.plist
```

#### 4. Verify the New File

The new file should have a REAL iOS App ID like:
```xml
<key>GOOGLE_APP_ID</key>
<string>1:491097328247:ios:abc123def456789</string>
```

NOT `PLACEHOLDER_IOS_APP_ID`.

#### 5. Rebuild iOS

```bash
cd apps/mobile
npx expo prebuild --clean
npx expo run:ios
```

## 📋 Configuration Checklist

### File Locations ✅
```
apps/mobile/
├── android/
│   └── app/
│       └── google-services.json          ✅ CORRECT LOCATION
└── ios/
    └── Plateful/
        └── GoogleService-Info.plist      ⚠️  NEEDS REAL FILE
```

### Package Identifiers ✅
All correctly set to: `com.plateful.app`

| Platform | Location | Value | Status |
|----------|----------|-------|--------|
| iOS Bundle ID | `app.json` | `com.plateful.app` | ✅ |
| Android Package | `app.json` | `com.plateful.app` | ✅ |
| Android Build | `build.gradle` | `com.plateful.app` | ✅ |
| Firebase Android | `google-services.json` | `com.plateful.app` | ✅ |
| Firebase iOS | `GoogleService-Info.plist` | `com.plateful.app` | ✅ |

### Firebase SDK Setup ✅
Currently using Firebase JS SDK v10 (modular) - this is correct.

---

## 🧪 Testing Firebase Connection

### After fixing iOS configuration, test both platforms:

#### Test Android
```bash
cd apps/mobile
npx expo run:android
# In Metro console, look for:
# ✅ Firebase App initialized successfully
# ✅ Firebase Auth initialized for native
```

#### Test iOS
```bash
cd apps/mobile
npx expo run:ios
# In Metro console, look for:
# ✅ Firebase App initialized successfully
# ✅ Firebase Auth initialized for native
```

### Test Authentication

1. **Go to sign-in screen**
2. **Try Google Sign-In** (this requires proper Firebase config)
3. **Check Metro logs for errors**

---

## 🎯 Understanding Your Package Name

### What is `com.plateful.app`?

This is your **unique app identifier** in reverse domain notation:

```
com.plateful.app
└── └────── └──
│   │       └── App name
│   └────────── Company/project name
└────────────── Top-level domain
```

**Why reverse domain?**
- Ensures global uniqueness (you own the domain)
- Standard convention for both iOS and Android
- Cannot be changed after publishing to app stores

**Where it's used:**
- 📱 iOS App Store (Bundle Identifier)
- 🤖 Google Play Store (Package Name)
- 🔥 Firebase project registration
- 🔑 Deep linking and OAuth redirects
- 📦 Android package structure: `com/plateful/app/`

## 🚀 What Changed and Why

### Before (Broken)
```
apps/mobile/
├── app/
│   └── google-services.json          ❌ Wrong location
└── ios/
    └── Plateful/
        └── GoogleService-Info.plist  ❌ Had PLACEHOLDER ID
```

### After (Fixed)
```
apps/mobile/
├── android/
│   └── app/
│       └── google-services.json      ✅ Correct location
└── ios/
    └── Plateful/
        └── GoogleService-Info.plist  ⏳ You need to replace this
```

### Why These Locations?

**Android**: The Gradle build system looks for `google-services.json` in:
```
android/app/google-services.json
```
This is processed by the Google Services Gradle plugin to generate resource files.

**iOS**: The Xcode build system looks for `GoogleService-Info.plist` in:
```
ios/Plateful/GoogleService-Info.plist
```
This is included in the app bundle and read at runtime.

## 🔐 Security Notes

### Current Setup (Using JS SDK)
✅ Firebase config values in environment variables (`EXPO_PUBLIC_*`)
✅ Client-side Firebase SDK
⚠️ All API keys are visible in the app bundle (this is normal and safe)

### Why Exposed API Keys Are Safe
Firebase API keys are **not secret** - they identify your Firebase project, but:
- Real security comes from **Firebase Security Rules**
- Your Firestore rules restrict access by `auth.uid`
- API keys can be restricted in Firebase Console

### Recommended API Key Restrictions

Go to Google Cloud Console:
```
https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=plateful-83021
```

For each API key:
1. **iOS key**: Restrict to Bundle ID `com.plateful.app`
2. **Android key**: Restrict to Package Name `com.plateful.app` + SHA-1 fingerprint
3. **Web key**: Restrict to your domains

---

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **[REQUIRED]** Download real `GoogleService-Info.plist` from Firebase Console
2. **[REQUIRED]** Replace the placeholder file
3. **[REQUIRED]** Rebuild iOS app
4. **[RECOMMENDED]** Set up API key restrictions in Google Cloud Console
5. **[RECOMMENDED]** Test Firebase Auth on both platforms
6. **[RECOMMENDED]** Test Firestore read/write on both platforms

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Error: "No Firebase App '[DEFAULT]' has been created"
- Check that environment variables are set (`.env` file)
- Verify `firebase.ts` is imported before any Firebase usage

### Error: "The package name [...] does not match the package name in google-services.json"
- Verify `package_name` in `google-services.json` is `com.plateful.app`
- Clean and rebuild: `npx expo prebuild --clean`

### Error: "MISSING_GOOGLE_APP_ID" (iOS)
- This means you still have the PLACEHOLDER file
- Download and replace `GoogleService-Info.plist`

### Google Sign-In not working
- **iOS**: Add `REVERSED_CLIENT_ID` to URL schemes (already configured)
- **Android**: Add SHA-1 fingerprint to Firebase Console
- Get SHA-1: `cd android && ./gradlew signingReport`
