# Ready to Deploy! 🚀

## ✅ What's Complete

Your CI/CD pipeline is fully configured! Here's the architecture:

```
GitHub Push → GitHub Actions → EAS Build → Play Store
     ↓
Your Mobile App → Calls API → Your Vercel Backend
```

## 🎯 Final Steps (Only 3 Steps Left!)

### Step 1: ✅ API URL Updated!
**Your API URL is now correctly configured:**

✅ Set to: `https://plateful-app-eta.vercel.app`
✅ Your API is working perfectly (I can see from your screenshots)
✅ Mobile app will now connect to your Vercel backend

**No action needed for this step!**

### Step 2: Set Up EAS Credentials (30 seconds)
```bash
cd apps/mobile
eas credentials
```
Choose: **Android → Production → "Set up new keystore"**

### Step 3: Push to Trigger CI/CD
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add mobile CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin main
```

## 🎉 What Happens Next (Automatic!)

1. **GitHub Actions starts** (check Actions tab)
2. **Tests run** (type checking, linting)
3. **EAS builds** your Android AAB
4. **Comments on your commit** with build status
5. **Ready for Play Store!**

## 📊 Monitor Your Build

- **GitHub**: Your repo → Actions tab
- **EAS**: [expo.dev](https://expo.dev) → your project
- **Build time**: ~15-20 minutes

## 🚀 Branch Strategy

- **Push to `main`**: Production build
- **Push to `develop`**: Preview build  
- **Push to `feature/*`**: Tests only

## ❓ Need Play Store Submission?

If you want automatic Play Store submission, you'll need the Google Service Account setup (optional for now - you can submit manually first).

**You're ready to go! Just run those 3 steps and your mobile CI/CD will be live! 🎉**
