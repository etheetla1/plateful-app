# EAS Configuration Fixed! ✅

## 🔧 What Was Wrong
The `eas.json` had an invalid `buildType` value:
- ❌ `"buildType": "aab"` (invalid)
- ✅ `"buildType": "app-bundle"` (correct)

## 🚀 Now Try Again

```bash
cd apps/mobile
eas credentials
```

Choose:
- **Android** → **Production** → **"Set up new keystore"**

## 📱 Then Push to Deploy

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: correct EAS buildType configuration"
git push origin main
```

## ✅ What This Will Do

1. **EAS credentials** will set up app signing
2. **GitHub Actions** will trigger on push
3. **Production build** will create Android App Bundle
4. **Ready for Play Store** submission

Your CI/CD pipeline is now properly configured! 🎉
